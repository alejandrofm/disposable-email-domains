# Apility.io - Disposable Email Addresses list

## What is a Disposable Email Address

Disposable email addressing (DEA) refers to an approach where a unique email address is used for every contact or entity. The benefit is that if anyone compromises the address or utilises it in connection email abuse, the address owner can easily cancel (or 'dispose' of) it without affecting any of their other contacts.

DEA can be used to mask the identities of abusers, because DEA providers don't store logs and don't care about checking real identities of their users.

## What does this repository contain?

This repo contains one or more files containing different domains that have been reported to Apility.io as a Disposable Email Address. As result, it has been added to the set of domain blacklist of Apility.io in the DEA blacklist: https://apility.io/list/DEA/type/baddomain

## Can I submit any domain found ?

Yes! There are two ways to do it:

### Submit a Pull Requests

Feel free to submit a Pull Requests. This will be the fastest and safest way to do it. All the domains will be verified, so please don't forget to add in the comment of the PR where did you find the domain (the provider of the service).

PR where the content of the files are sorted lexicographically are nicer and easier to manage ;-)


### Post an issue

If you post an issue, we will modify the files for you, but it can take longer. The issue should contain:

* The names of the domains (it can be a list, of course)
* The service name where you find them (if any).

## What happens next?

Once the PR or the Issue is submitted I will review the content to accept or reject it. If it's accepted, then an automatic process of Apility.io will parse the file and the runtime database of Apility will be updated. This process occurs every day.

## Can I use the content of the lists in my own applications?

Of course! Please do it! Also keep in mind that Apility.io has several up to date lists that you can use: https://apility.io/lists/baddomain
